# Capstone project **"Winning Space Race with Data Science"**

In the project, we use a variety of machine learning models to predict the successful landing of Falcon 9 rocket, the optimum method to predict if the first stage will land successfully was founded. SpaceX advertises Falcon 9 rocket launches on its website with a cost of 62 million dollars; other providers cost upward of 165 million dollars each. As we know, much of the savings that helps to evaluate the cost comes from the first stage rocket reuse. Thatâ€™s why the cost of a launch can also be determined based on its successful landing. The results of the work can be used if an alternate company wants to bid against SpaceX for a rocket launch.

## During the work we:
- Perform Web scraping and made a get request to the SpaceX API to collect Falcon 
9 data.
- Perform Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA), Feature Engineering and determine 
Training Labels.
- Build an Interactive Map with Folium and Dashboard with Plotly Dash.

## The main results:
- The best Hyperparameter for SVM, Classification Trees and Logistic Regression is 
found.
- The method that performs best in the first stage rocket successful landing 
prediction using test data is found. 

## Data
- We made a get request to the SpaceX API and performed web scraping to collect Falcon 9 historical launch records from a Wikipedia page.
- We perform data wrangling and downloaded the dataframe, found bad outcomes, and picked the classification variable that represents the outcome of each launch
