# Petroleum-producing prediction with Bootstrap

## Project Description
There are 10,000 fields where the quality and the reserves of oil have been measured. Build a machine learning model to help determine the region where mining will bring the most profit. Analyze possible profits and risks using the Bootstrap technique.

## Data

* id - the oil bore identifier;
* f0, f1, f2 are three signs of points;
* product â€” volumetric reserves in the bore (thousand barrels).

## Libraries used
- pandas
- numpy
- seaborn
- matplotlib
- sklearn
