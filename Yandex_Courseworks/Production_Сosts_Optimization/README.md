# Metallurgical Plant Production Costs Optimization

## Goals

- Optimize the production costs of a metallurgical plant by reducing electricity consumption at the stage of steel processing.
- Build a model that predicts the steel temperature at the final stage.

## Data

- data_arc.csv - electrode data;
- ata_bulk.csv - data on the supply of bulk materials (volume);
- data_bulk_time.csv - data on the supply of bulk materials (time);
- data_gas.csv - data on alloy gas purge;
- data_temp.csv - temperature measurement results;
- data_wire.csv - data on wire materials (volume);
- data_wire_time.csv - data on wire materials (time).
