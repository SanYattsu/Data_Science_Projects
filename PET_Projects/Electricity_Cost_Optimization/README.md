# Optimization and Calculation of the Electricity Cost

## Project Description

Implement an algorithm that simulates the operation of an electricity storage (storage) system in order to minimize the total costs for the purchase of electrical energy and power, and services for their transmission.

## Tasks

- Get an adjusted hourly graph of total payload and storage consumption.
- Build an hourly storage load schedule.
- Determine the cost of electricity and power for the actual consumption schedule.
- Determine the cost of electricity and power for an adjusted consumption schedule.
- Reduce electricity costs.

## Libraries used

- pandas
- numpy
- seaborn
- matplotlib
- tqdm
- scipy
