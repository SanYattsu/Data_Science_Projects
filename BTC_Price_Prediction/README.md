# Capstone project **"Price and Trend Prediction BTC-USD"**

In the project, we use a variety of deep learning models to predict BTC-USD prices and trend.

## During the work we:
- Perform Web scraping (Praw) and made a get request to the Reddit API to get news data.
- Perform Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA), Feature Engineering.
- Use different deep learning models for stateful and classification tasks.

## The main results:
- The work shows that with little tinning deep learning models can be used for trading, but future research is needed.
- News didn't affect the price in long run. It's hard to use them for trend prediction.

## Libraries used
- pandas
- numpy 
- matplotlib
- sklearn
- keras
- requests
- datetime
- praw
- re
